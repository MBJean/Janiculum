<entryFree id="n51504" type="main" key="Y"><orth extent="full" lang="la">Y</orth>, <orth type="alt" extent="full" lang="la">y</orth>, <itype>a Greek letter introduced at a late period for words borrowed from the Greek</itype>, the place of the Greek <foreign lang="greek">*u</foreign> being previously filled by U (i. e. V, which graphically originated from <foreign lang="greek">*u</foreign>; v. the letters U and V). Thus, according to the express testimony of Cicero (Or. 48, 160), Ennius always wrote Burrus for Pyrrhus, and Bruges for Phryges; and so the words which were identical in Greek and Latin in the oldest period of the language have either preserved <sense id="n51504.0" n="I" level="1"><hi rend="ital">u</hi> where the Greek has <foreign lang="greek">u</foreign>, as bucina and <foreign lang="greek">buka/nh</foreign>, cubus and <foreign lang="greek">ku/bos</foreign>, fuga and <foreign lang="greek">fugh/</foreign>, mus and <foreign lang="greek">mu=s</foreign> et saep.; or this <hi rend="ital">u</hi> has given place to <hi rend="ital">i</hi>, as in lacrima, formerly lacruma, = <foreign lang="greek">da/kruma</foreign>. Sometimes, also, <hi rend="ital">o</hi> took the place of the <foreign lang="greek">u</foreign>; cf. mola and <foreign lang="greek">mu/lh</foreign>, sorex and <foreign lang="greek">u(/rac</foreign>, folium and <foreign lang="greek">fu/llon</foreign>, and, shortening a long vowel, ancora and <foreign lang="greek">a)/gkura</foreign>, like lacrima and <foreign lang="greek">da/kru=ma</foreign>. In Cicero's time <hi rend="ital">y</hi> seems to have been already in use; but its application was restricted to foreign words, and hence the spellings Sylla, Tybris, pyrum, satyra, etc., are to be rejected. <cb n="Z."/></sense></entryFree>
